        <p>The Velliangiri hills form a major range in the Western Ghats in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The seven hills with altitudes ranging from 520 m – 1840 m are bordered by the plains of Coimbatore district to the east, the Palakad district of Kerala on the western boundary, the Nilgiri mountains to the north, and the Siruvani hills on the southern boundary. The annual rainfall is quite variable in the hills (500 mm – 7000 mm) with temperatures ranging from 0 °C during winter to 41 °C in the summer. Many seasonal rivers such as the Neelivaikal, Mayar or Andisunai traverse the hilly landscape. The Noyyal river originating from Velliangiri hills is one of the major tributaries of the Cauvery, which irrigates about 100,000 of hectares of agricultural land in the plains. The Velliangiri hills watershed feeds into the Siruvani dam, which is the main drinking water supply for 1,500,000 people in the urban centre of Coimbatore.[2]

            Vegetation is predominantly dry deciduous forests of foothills, second and third mount have evergreen forest and last four belt up shola forest types.</p> <hr/>

        <p>As per the Kachiappar Perur Purana, Lord Shiva in the hill of Kailayam (Mount Kailash), was worshipped by Lord Vishnu-Komuni. The gracious Lord Shiva appeared before him and asked, "What is your wish?" "My eyes have not seen your dance of grace (Aananda Thaandava). So I wish to see that, said Vishnu. Lord Shiva said: "The two sages Patanjali and Vyaghrapada have performed some of their virtues, and I showed them my dance in Vellinangiri.(Om Nama Shivaya)

            In the same way, Lord Vishnu obeyed the command of the Lord Shiva, wearing the Rudraksham, Lord Vishnu went to the southwest of Velliangiri hills and worshipped Lord Shiva.[3]
            
            As per a legend, Vayu Bhaghvan and Adiseshan had a dispute to find out who is superior, to prove the superiority adiseshan encircled the Kailasam, Vayu tried to remove this encircle by creating santamarutham (Twister). Because of the santamarutham, 8 kodumudigal (parts) fell from kailasam into 8 different places which are Thirugonamalai (Trincomalee), Thirukalahasti, Thiruchiramalai, Thiruenkoimalai, Velliangiri Mountains at Rajathagiri, Neerthagiri, Ratnagiri, and Swethagiri or Thirupangeeli.[4]</p> <hr/>
